The commands and online resources are introduced through a review of arithmetic, complex numbers, algebra, Euclidean geometry, trigonometry, coordinate systems and graphing, elementary functions and transformations, series, derivatives, integrals, vectors and matrices. There may be additional topics from domains such as number theory, differential equations, integral transforms, probability and statistics.",3,"Students who have received credit for MAST 332 or COMP 367 or COMP 467 may not take this course for credit","","The following courses must be completed previously: MATH 204 and MATH 205, or equivalent",TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,""
