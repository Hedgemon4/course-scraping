The unsupervised learning methods include Hierarchical Clustering, K-means, and Model-based Clustering methods. Furthermore, the course also covers dimension reduction techniques such as LASSO and Ridge Regression, and model checking criteria. Some data visualization methods will be introduced in this course as well.",3,"","","ST362.","Hours per week:Lecture/Discussion: 3Lab: 1.5 (biweekly)",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,""
