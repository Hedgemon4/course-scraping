"1","DATA100","Introduction to Data Analytics","This course provides a broad overview of modern methods and tools for big data analytics. Different stages of data analytics lifecycle including diagnosing, cleaning, preparing, transforming, visualizing and modelling data are considered. Numerical and graphical methods of descriptive statistics are introduced. Data analytic methods are demonstrated using tools such as Excel, Google spreadsheets, Python and the R package.",3,"","CP104.","","Hours per week:Lecture/Discussion: 3Lab: 1.5",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,""
"2","DATA200","Data Analytics","In this course concepts and techniques introduced in DATA100 will be reinforced. Students will explore the data science lifecycle, including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, exploratory data analysis and visualization, statistical inference and prediction, and decision-making. This course will focus on quantitative critical thinking and key principles and techniques needed to carry out this cycle. The main topics include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing. The statistical computing software R will primarily be used to demonstrate the techniques. Other programming tools may include Excel and Python.",3,"","One of ST230, ST231, ST260, or equivalent.","DATA100.","Hours per week:Lecture/Discussion: 3Lab: 1.5 (biweekly)",TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,""
